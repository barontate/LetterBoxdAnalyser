# LetterBoxdAnalyser

Just something I'm working on to get some more indepth stats from my Letterboxd profile

Uses the 'https://github.com/cinemagoer/cinemagoer' Python wrapper for the IMDB API

## Usage

You need to download your Letterboxd data.
To do this, log into Letterboxd go to your Username at the top, click on settings, 
then "Import & Export", then export your data.

Unzip the download and find the 'watched.csv' file.

Run this python script with the location of that file as an argument eg.
> python main.py watched.csv
